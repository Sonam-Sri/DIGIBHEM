# DIGIBHEM
Project Goal: To create a simple game that is fun to play and that demonstrates the ability to use Java to create user interfaces, handle input and output, and implement basic game logic.
The provided Java code presents a simple Number Guessing Game. This text-based game invites users to guess a randomly generated number within a predetermined range. The code begins by importing necessary classes for user input and random number generation. The main class, NumberGuessingGame, houses the game's core logic.This game encapsulates a basic yet engaging user experience. Through the interplay of user input, random number generation, and conditional statements, it creates an interactive environment where players can test their intuition and numerical estimation skills. By providing feedback on the user's guesses, the game offers a simple yet effective way to learn basic programming concepts and engage in an entertaining guessing activity.
